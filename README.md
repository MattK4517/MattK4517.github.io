# YoutubePlaylist
using the youtube v3 api by Google
a project that allows a user to login and will analyze data from it, inspired by spotify wrapped
eventually want to make a front end site that allows user to post link to playlist and it shows them the same data
using matplotlib and pandas for data currently storing in an excel sheet
